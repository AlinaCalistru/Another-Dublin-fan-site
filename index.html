In domestic architecture, doorways were flanked by pilasters and surmounted by wide fanlights with delicate, lead glazing bars - creating the iconic Dublin doorcase - while windows were made taller and wider. It was also during this period that the light and delicate style of decorative plasterwork flourished, coinciding with a fashion for coordinated interior design. While known as the  Robert Adam style, it was usually executed by Irish artisans such as the stuccodore Michael Stapleton and a host of lesser known plasterers who essentially built the Georgian city.">

Public parks include the Phoenix Park, Herbert Park and St Stephen's Green. The Phoenix Park is about 3 km west of the city centre, north of the River Liffey. Its 16-kilometre perimeter wall encloses 707 hectares, making it one of the largest walled city parks in Europe. It includes large areas of grassland and tree-lined avenues, and since the 17th century has been home to a herd of wild Fallow deer. The residence of the President of Ireland, which was built in 1751, is located in the park. The park is also home to Dublin Zoo, Ashtown Castle, and the official residence of the United States Ambassador. Music concerts are also sometimes held in the park. St Stephen's Green is adjacent to one of Dublin's main shopping streets, Grafton Street, and to a shopping centre named for it, while on its surrounding streets are the offices of a number of public bodies.">

There‚Äôs a light rail system, the LUAS, with the Green Line running a north/south route from Broombridge to Bride‚Äôs Glen and the Red Line running west/east from Saggart to the Point. Dublinbikes, the most successful citywide bike hire scheme in Europe, is loved by the locals. Beyond that, there‚Äôs plenty of taxis, or you can hire a car.">

Known for reworking myth into contemporary narratives, as well as incorporating the character of the city into his works, Joyce was one of the key players of Modernism, whose works came to define the movement. These are the major works, in chronological order, produced by this Dublin native: Dubliners (1914), A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916), Exiles (1918), Ulysses (1922), Pomes Penyeach (1927), Finnegans Wake (1939),
               James Joyce once declared that if Dublin one day suddenly disappeared from the Earth it could be reconstructed out of my book - Ulysses. ">

It takes the form of a multicoloured circular arc. Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the sun. Rainbows can be observed whenever there are water drops in the air and sunlight shining from behind the observer at a low altitude angle. Because of this, rainbows are usually seen in the western sky during the morning and in the eastern sky during the early evening. The most spectacular rainbow displays happen when half the sky is still dark with raining clouds and the observer is at a spot with clear sky in the direction of the sun. The result is a luminous rainbow that contrasts with the darkened background.  ">

They are usually depicted as little bearded men, wearing a coat and hat, who partake in mischief. They are solitary creatures who spend their time making and mending shoes and have a hidden pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. If captured by a human, they often grant three wishes in exchange for their freedom. Like other Irish fairies, leprechauns may be derived from the Tuatha D√© Danann. Leprechaun-like creatures rarely appear in Irish mythology and only became prominent in later folklore.">
